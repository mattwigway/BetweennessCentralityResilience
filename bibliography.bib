Centrality measures are used in network science to rank the relative importance of nodes and edges of a graph. Here we define new measures of centrality for power grids that are based on its functionality. More specifically, the coupling of the grid network can be expressed as the algebraic equation YU\,=\,I, where U and I represent the vectors of complex bus voltage and injected current phasors; and Y is the network admittance matrix which is defined not only by the~connecting topology but also by the network's electrical parameters and can be viewed as a complex-weighted Laplacian. We show that the relative importance analysis based on centrality in graph theory can be performed on power grid network with its electrical parameters taken into account. In the chapter the proposed electrical centrality measures are experimented with on the NYISO-2935 system and the IEEE 300-bus system. The centrality distribution is analyzed in order to identify important nodes or branches in the system which are of essential importance in terms of system vulnerability. A number of interesting discoveries are also presented and discussed regarding the importance rank of power grid nodes and branches.},

By analysing two sub-networks, one residential and the other a central network, significant spatial associations between pipes with high centrality values and those exhibiting adverse conditions (poor CCTV grades, previous blockages, and low self-cleaning capabilities) were identified. Path-based centrality measures, particularly edge betweenness and K-path edge centrality were less influenced by weights when identifying critical pipes. In contrast, non-path-based measures like nearest neighbour edge centrality could identify more localised critical pipes within the sewer networks investigated. The results showed that the spatial patterns between critical pipes and pipes in adverse conditions were not random and could support proactive maintenance planning and the development of more resilient networks. Additionally, the impact of network structure, connectivity, and differences in the composition of pipe attributes could contribute to variations in the strength of observable spatial associations.},

The ability of an infrastructure system to withstand, to adapt to, and to recover rapidly from extreme events is paramount in the ability to serve users. The effects of historical climatic events have resulted in a growing concern for preparedness against such hazards, specifically in coastal communities. The continuing function of society and its economy relies heavily on an accessible transportation network. Roads, highways, railroads, ports, and airports make up a complex infrastructure vital for the travel of goods and people. Extreme events of climatic source that disturb the transportation network affect all aspects of daily life, both directly and indirectly. To estimate the resilience of coastal transportation networks to extreme events, topological graph properties are measured as the nodes and links of a network are removed to simulate failures and closures due to extreme climatic events. The transportation network of the New York City metropolitan area, the most populous and crucial urban area in the United States, was chosen as a case study. The presented approach provides a tool for transportation agencies to identify the most critical sections of the network and to establish pre-event hazard mitigation strategies or to plan for postevent recovery actions with the goal of increasing the resiliency and decreasing the down time of transportation networks.},

  abstract = {Most of the largest rivers on Earth have multiple active channels connected at bifurcations and confluences. At present a method to describe a channel network pattern and changes in the network beyond the simplistic braiding index is unavailable. Our objectives are to test a network approach to understand the character, stability and evolution of a multi-channel river pattern under natural discharge conditions. We developed a semi-automatic method to derive a chain-like directional network from images that represent the multi-channel river and to connect individual network elements through time. The Jamuna River was taken as an example with a series of Landsat TM and ETM+ images taken at irregular intervals between 1999 and 2004. We quantified the overall importance of individual channels in the entire network using a centrality property. Centrality showed that three reaches can be distinguished along the Jamuna with a different network character: the middle reach has dominantly one important channel, while upstream and downstream there are about two important channels. Temporally, relatively few channels changed dramatically in both low-flow and high-flow periods despite the increase of braiding index during a flood. Based on the centrality we calculated a weighted braiding index that represents the number of important channels in the network, which is about two in the Jamuna River and which is larger immediately after floods. We conclude that the network measure centrality provides a novel characterization of river channel networks, highlighting properties and tendencies that have morphological significance.

Although a rich volume of centrality metrics has been developed from 1940s, only some centrality metrics (e.g., degree, betweenness, or cluster coefficient) have been commonly in use. This paper aims to introduce various existing centrality metrics and discusses their applicabilities in various networks. In addition, we conducted extensive simulation study in order to demonstrate and analyze the network resilience of targeted attacks using the surveyed centrality metrics under four real network topologies. We also discussed algorithmic complexity of centrality metrics surveyed in this work. Through the extensive experiments and discussions of the surveyed centrality metrics, we encourage their use in solving various computing and engineering problems in networks.},

  abstract = {Urban rail transit systems and metro-led underground space contribute to urban resilience. The critical level of metro-led underground space in a metro network demands different resilience requirements, thereby rendering the identification of critical metro stations before the evaluation of the resilience contribution essential. This study optimized the identification of critical metro stations in terms of network model construction and evaluation methods to suit urban resilience perspective. The optimized metro network model considered the influence of transfers, difference between above-ground and underground routes, and cost between adjacent stations, to construct an undirected weighted graph of a metro network. Three evaluation metrics: node betweenness, network efficiency loss, and route redundancy, were adopted for a comprehensive identification method of critical stations. The optimized identification method was applied to the Shanghai Metro network (402 stations and 481 links by 2023). The betweenness identified the downtown stations to be more critical, whereas the network efficiency loss and route redundancy identified the critical stations at downtown-suburban connections. Moreover, the vulnerability and distribution of above-ground stations influenced the identification result of critical stations. The identification results are expected to facilitate the resilience evaluation of metro-led underground space, to examine whether the contribution is balanced with the demand.},

However, they must also maintain an acceptable level of service to critical infrastructures in the case of disruptions, especially during natural disasters. We have developed a method for assessing the resilience of transportation network topology when exposed to environmental hazards. This approach integrates graph theory with stress testing methodology and involves five basic steps: (1) establishment of a scenario set that covers a range of seismic damage potential in the network, (2) assessment of resilience using various graph-based metrics, (3) topology-based simulations, (4) evaluation of changes in graph-based metrics, and (5) examination of resilience in terms of spatial distribution of critical nodes and the entire network topology. Our case study was from the city of Kathmandu in Nepal, where the earthquake on April 25, 2015, followed by a major aftershock on May 12, 2015, led to numerous casualties and caused significant damage. Therefore, it is a good example for demonstrating and validating the developed methodology. The results presented here indicate that the proposed approach is quite efficient and accurate in assisting stakeholders when evaluating the resilience of transportation networks based on their topology.},

The study contributes to existing literature by incorporating risk in\- teractions and failure propagation through a Travel Demand Modeling process. The analysis follows a three-step analytical approach, including identifying climate change scenarios, modeling climate stressors, and analyzing transportation system response. The results show potentially severe climate change threats, leading to 0.23 --1.24\% of trips underserved and 2.74 -- 15.11\% of roadway links on the southern coast operating at a speed of fewer than 10 mph. Moreover, the analysis reveals clear spatial patterns in climate change impacts, with the northern coast experiencing more inaccessibility and the southern coast facing greater congestion. The results show a non-linear and dynamic response of roadway system to climate change. The study highlights four policy implications, including increasing system redundancy, protecting critical infrastructure, acknowledging spatial disparities, and considering potential relocation strategies. The analysis also sheds lights on the mechanism behind roadway system response, showing the possible existence of a tipping point.},

Existing structural redundancy metrics tend to emphasize the criticality of links (infrastructure-focused) or the pairwise redundancy of origin-destination (OD) connections under equal weighting (demand-agnostic), overlooking place- and population-specific differences in redundancy. This study introduces an alternative population-based, demand-aware redundancy metric to evaluate structural redundancy at the census block group level by integrating origin-specific demand distributions derived from mobility data with a path-penalized Dijkstra's algorithm to evaluate redundancy separately for each census block group. This population-centered approach aligns with transportation justice principles and provides an accessible tool for assessing heterogeneities in local access to road network redundancy. Applied to North Carolina, the metric highlights geographic variation in redundancy across the state, especially considering urban-rural and regional divides, and identifies populations in western North Carolina as having comparatively lower access to redundancy. The findings of the case study underscore the necessity of considering road networks' unique structural characteristics in planning for equitable and resilient transportation systems.},

While traditional measures of link importance capture a link's role for transport efficiency under normal conditions, we are interested in a link's role for transport robustness and network redundancy. We refer to this concept as redundancy importance and introduce two measures based on traffic flow and disruption impacts (here operationalized as travel delay), respectively. In the flow-based measure we consider the net traffic flow that is redirected to the studied link when other links are closed. In the impact-based measure we also consider the impact that is avoided through the studied link, i.e., how much worse the next-best backup alternatives would be if the studied link itself would not be available. We argue that although a link may not be important under normal conditions, a higher prioritization in resource allocations could be justified if many users could come to rely on it in extraordinary situations. Hence, these measures should be useful as quantitative decision support in the allocation of resources for investments and maintenance as well as for setting up pre-emptive rerouting plans. The measures are applied in a case study of northern Sweden and the general characteristics that determine which links are redundancy important are identified.},

Extreme events (including both natural hazards and manmade disasters) have caused terrible physical damages to the transportation infrastructure, longterm socioeconomic impacts, and psychological damages. There is an increasing number of studies focusing on the resilience analysis of the transportation infrastructure to support planning and design and to optimize emergency management and restoration schedules. We provide a comprehensive review of recent literature on the metrics and methods for resilience analyses of the transportation infrastructure under extreme events. The paper covers functionality metrics, functionality-based resilience metrics and socio-economic resilience metrics. Despite the advancements of research in resilience, there are still fundamental challenges to comprehensively evaluate the resilience of the transportation infrastructure, especially due to two main sources of complexity: uncertainties and interdependencies, which are discussed in the paper. We also point out that validations of resilience assessments are limited due to the general scarcity of data, which may hinder the practical applications. Finally, directions for future research in this field are suggested. The paper provides an organized overview of the many lines of research in the field, accomplishments, and open gaps. It indicates useful starting points for researchers new to this field, and serves as a reference for teams already active on this topic.},
