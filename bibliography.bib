  abstract = {The resilience of transportation systems has been extensively studied in the past decade. This paper aims to provide a synthesis of the up-to-date literature on resilient transportation, focusing on concepts and methodologies. A systematic literature search method integrating database search, related journal search, and citation supplement is proposed to select all the appropriate articles. Based on the selected core papers, the definition of resilience is examined, and some related concepts are compared. The main body of the paper is devoted to the review of metrics and mathematical models used to measure resilience and the strategies used to enhance resilience. Several popular subtopics are identified and discussed. Finally, current research gaps and challenges are addressed, and some potential research directions are presented.},
